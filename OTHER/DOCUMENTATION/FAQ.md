1 How do I use OSD / smart switch / Screen switching
  * There are 2 methods - using a RC channel (1-8) or by using OSD SWITCH if the FC supports it.
  * Select which method on the GUI
  * if using RC Channel, just make sure you use the correct channel. Numbering changed after 1.6

2 I have nothing on my display?
  * Ensure your cabling is correct
  * Ensure your PAL/NTSC OSD setting matches your camera setting.
  * If using MinimOSD board make sure your output stage is properly powered.
  * Ensure you do not have blank screen layout selected
  * If using 3 way switch try different position
  * If using FRSKY or other high frequency RSSI, unplug until resolved.
  * Some stups require a consistent ground between camera and OSD video output
  * Check camera compatility documentation

---

3 Lines on my display are very feint and flickering at all times
  * This is usually a compatibility issue with the camera. Check camera compatility documentation
  * Use a large font file such as the one from ABL
  * Try increasing brightness and enabling fastpixel in config.h
  * if your camera is hi res (650TVL+) change camera CRT/LCD setting to LCD

4 I can't open GUI on my MAC - unidentified developer error / unable to open
  * http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion
  
* Ensure the application.macosx/MW_OSD_GUI.app/Contents/MacOS/MW_OSD_GUI file is executable
  * If not issue chmod +x on that file

---

5 I can't open GUI on my MAC -  .app is damaged and can’t be opened

6 How do I setup a current sensor
  * The information is now updated in the calibration guide

---

7 My OSD turns off in flight / after powering up motors?
  * Ensure you have a good ground
  * Use a big cap (e.g. 3300uf) on the 5v supply to the OSD
  * Enable #define MAXSTALLDETECT in config or upgrade if not listed as an option

---

8 I get white glow effect/white streaks behind the osd text with Fatshark PilotHD
  * Set the following in config.h
  * #define FASTPIXEL
  * #define WHITEBRIGHTNESS 0xB

---

9 My voltage doesn't change during flight
 * Check you have selected teh correct board in OSD HARDWARE settings
 * Check you have selected the correct battery option - FC if using FC connection
 * If using a micro board, you probably have to select RTFQMICRO
 * If using a full size witespy board you may have to select RTFQV1 in config.h
 * Ensure you are connected to the correct vbat pin some are reversed bat1 / bat2
 * Enable SWAPVOLTAGEPINS if you don't want to swap physical wires.

---

10 My Voltage/RSSI/Current does not change with adjusters
  * Note that adjusters are only for connections direct to OSD - NOT when connected via the controller

---

11 The OSD always shows NO DATA / DISARMED permanentlty and one or more other items do not work
  * This usually means the OSD is not getting information from the Flight Controller
  * Ensure your connections are correct. Especially tx/rx orientation
  * Makes sure you are using the correct baud rate - 115k is default
  * You cannot share serial with other devices like telemetry
  * Note it can be disabled in config.h
  * Baud rate in config.h MUST match baud rate in GUI (access via comsettings button)

BASEFLIGHT USERS - remove telemetry as follows:
  * feature -TELEMETRY

CLEANFLIGHT USERS - remove telemetry and enable GPS as follows:
  * feature -TELEMETRY
  * set serial\_port\_1\_scenario = 5
  * set serial\_port\_2\_scenario = 2
  * SAVE
setting port 1 to 5 equates to MSP, CLI, GPS-PASSTHROUGH
setting port 2 assigns it for gps , feature GPS will also need to be enabled

HARAKIRI USERS - ensure protocol set as follows:
  * tele\_prot=0

---

12 The OSD always shows random characters on the NESW compass heading
  * This is typically a mismatch between the Flight controller type and the OSD controller selected in config.h
  * Latest version of OSD should correct for this

---

13 Data does not save when press write on the GUI.
  * Pre 1.3, this is typically a mismatch between OSD and GUI versions.
  * If unable to update firmware, also check rx/tx connections are correct.
  * Ensure USB programmer provides correct voltage
  * Note some programmers have 3.3v/5v selection text swapped. Verify with a meter

---

14 I get garbage characters and / or font upload doesn't work.
  * Sounds like fonts need to be re-uploaded - but note:
  * The output stage (max chip) MUST be powered when uploading font. How depends upon your board / configuration
  * A programming voltage of 4.8v or higher is required.
  * Note some programmers have 3.3v/5v selection text swapped. Verify with a meter
  * Some stacked boards with USB connector also require vbat connected which powers the MAX chip and enables font upload

---

15 I don't know if I should enable 5v ADC. When should I?
  * If using analog RSSI connected directly to OSD you must enable 5v ADC
  * If using a hardware Current sensor connected directly to OSD you must enable 5v ADC
  * If using more than 4 cells you must enable 5v ADC

---

16 Direction, distance and speed are not working
  * Normally the FC needs to be armed. Not applicable to GPS/FIXEDWING mode

---

17 I can't enter values into the GUI
  * Click onto the box and drag up / down. Obvious eh ?!

---

18 I can't enter OSD menu
  * FULL RATES are required for the stick menus to be selected currently

---

19 How do I use MAP mode? It doesn't seem to work
  * Quick answer: Select HUD layout 4 and set MAP mode to 1
  * Long answer:
  * Firstly items to be displayed need to be enabled in the hud layout being used. (Map Mode & Map Center)
  * Secondly - on the GUI or OSD menu, map mode buts be set from 1-4.
  *  - mode 1 is where aircraft is center and H displays home location
  *  - mode 2 is where Home is center of the map and X displays relative aircraft position
  *  - mode 3 is a combination of mode 2 and 3
  *  - mode 4 is low resolution, but with ^ indicating location of aircraft and heading

20 I get c:\..... \java\javapath\javaw.exe unspecified error or javapath error. How do I fix it.
  * There are many type of Java error. It us usually related to Java not setting up paths correctly. The most common ones have a solution in the video below:
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66crhKstr70

21 I get "Waiting FC” or "Waiting OSD". How do I fix it.
  * Ensure you are connected to the correct com port. 
  * Ensure baud rate in GUI matches baud rate on the OSD
  * Ensure only the OSD is connected to programmer
  * If using OSDOGE ensure switch is in correct position for programming
  * If using cheap OSDOGE/BROSD clone, disconnect board from the Naze32
  * Restart PC – especially if hibernated
  * Ensure physical connections are correct. Test by re-uploading MWOSD if necessary to verify
  * Upload EEPROM_Clear example sketch then re-upload MWOSD sketch. 
  * Set serial port default value on PC to be same as OSD (e.g. device manager>ports>comx>port settings)

---

22 I get A screen full of error messages trying to load the GUI - inside the text is "Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform" 
  * You are probably trying to run 64 bit MWOSD GUI on a PC running 32 bit java
  * Try running 32 bit MWOSD GUI instead or change java to 64 bit version instead.

23 GUI will not launch
  * Try both 32 and 64 bit versions
  * Check other GUI FAQ points (therere a re several)
  * Completely uninstall all Java versions and re-install latest. Note you will have to google to find instructions to completely remove. As part of this, make sure path variables are completely erased before re-installing.

24 How do I use RSSI with FRSKY (D4R-II)
  * RECOMMENDED - Use an LC filter like CASE 2 here : https://code.google.com/p/minoposd/wiki/AnalogRSSI
  * Connect directly to NAZE like this : https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/blob/master/docs/Rssi.md
  * For Taranis users there is this option: http://blog.oscarliang.net/rssi-ppm-channel-taranis/
  * For 9x/9xr OpenTX users there is this option: http://fpvlab.com/forums/showthread.php?34250-MWOSD-for-MULTIWII-NAZE32-BASEFLIGHT-HARIKIRI&p=741209&viewfull=1#post741209

---
25 Display keeps blinking. May be worse at high throttle
  * This is noise on the power to the OSD. It needs to be sorted
  * Google LC power filter for FPV

---
26 GUI very slow to update / unable to turn simulator off
  * Edit gui.cfg in GUI data folder
  * Set AutoSimulator to 0
  * Note it may also be a sign of an old pc or other application / malware running on PC

---
27 Can I swap between different batteries 3/4s and set alarms automatically
  * Use R1.6 and higher
  * uncomment AUTOCELL
  * Amend Woltage waring section in config.h as you require 
  * Consider use of AUTOCELL_VOLTAGE  

---
28 GUI is very slow to open up
  * Try disabling buetooth

SPECIAL NOTE - POWER ISSUES  
  Poor quality voltage supply can significantly impact the the reliability of your the system. This ranges from high voltage spikes that will cause your FC or OSD to fail completely to low voltage brownouts that will cause your FC or OSD to hang. All are bad, but all can be avoided.
  Regenerative / Braked ESC such as those using BLHeli / Damped light option contribute significantly to the issue.
  Systems with digital servos powered through the FC are also vulnerable.

  It is important to provide a clean supply to your FC and OSD etc. Consider 5v and 12v connections (and also for FC/OSD with embedded switching regulator , the battery supply). Also consider any servos connected to the 5v on the FC.

Options to consider in order of recommendation of least effective to most effective are:
  * Use a good ground wiring layout design to a common point (consider this mandatory)
  * Use a high value electrolytic cap on supply lines (3300uf, 16v for 4s. 25v better but larger)
  * Use a Low ESR, high value cap on the supply lines (1000uf, 16v low ESR for 4s. 25v better but larger). 
  * Use a traditional inductor / capacitor (LC) filter on the supply lines to the electronics
  * Use a linear voltage regulator circuit (7805/7812 etc)

For overvoltage protection:
  Consider use of a protection diode (BZX79C5V6)
